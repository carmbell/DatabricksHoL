## What is Azure Databricks?

The Azure Databricks Lakehouse Platform provides a unified set of tools for building, deploying, sharing, and maintaining enterprise-grade data solutions at scale. Azure Databricks integrates with cloud storage and security in your cloud account, and manages and deploys cloud infrastructure on your behalf.

Unlike many enterprise database companies, Azure Databricks does not force you to migrate your data into proprietary storage systems in order to use the platform. Instead, you configure a Azure Databricks workspace by configuring secure integrations between the Azure Databricks platform and your cloud account, and then Azure Databricks deploys ephemeral compute clusters using cloud resources in your account to process and store data in object storage and other integrated services you control.
